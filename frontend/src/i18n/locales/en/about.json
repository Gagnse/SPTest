  "title": "About Us",
  "teamIntro": "We are a team of four undergraduate computer science students from Université Laval. The idea to create this platform came as part of a term project for a database course. With one member having experience in the field of architecture, it was easier to understand the challenges in that world. By gathering feedback from colleagues on existing software, Sébastien came up with the idea of a platform that would keep the strengths of competitors while improving their weaknesses. That idea became SpaceLogic.",
  "missionTitle": "Our Mission",
  "missionText": "SpaceLogic aims to simplify the coordination of architectural projects between architects and their clients. We believe that better communication between the two parties saves time, reduces errors, and improves the quality of completed projects."
